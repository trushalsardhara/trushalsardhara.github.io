Focused ion beam (FIB) tomography is a destructive imaging technique for collecting 3D structural information of micrometer sized samples at nanometer resolution. It requires a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an additional FIB column. The SEM functionality is used for imaging serial-sections created with the focused ion beam. With state-of the art instruments, sample volumes of up to several thousand cubic micrometers can be imaged with a resolution of less than 5 nm in the imaging plane and as little as 5 nm in the slicing direction. Therefore, FIB tomography often serves as a 3D imaging method in between scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) tomography (sample volumes of a few cubic micrometers at a resolution of about 1 nm) and X-ray nano-tomography (sample volumes of a few hundred cubic micrometers at a resolution of as little as 50 nm).
