In the field of manufacturing engineering, it is seen that the trend is to produce quicker, proficient and high multifaceted products, which includes utilizing an awesome number of tools in the machining procedure. One of the significant answers for rapid and effective assembling depends on adjusting the procedure which is completely robotized. This intention is satisfied by CNCs. The smooth keep running of the innovative procedure on CNCs is guaranteed by the programmed tool changers (ATC) through the complete automation of the tool change operation grouping and legitimate holding of the tools in both of the tool holders of mechanical arm. For satisfying this reason, Lubrication assumes principle part as when ointment separates the two surfaces of the relative movement, it diminishes the friction between them. In this research an effort is made to solve the lubrication issue associated with the ATC mechanical arm and an embedded system is designed as a solution to that problem.
