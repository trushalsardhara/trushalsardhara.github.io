FIB-SEM tomography is a powerful technique that integrates a focused ion beam (FIB) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to capture high-resolution imaging data of nanostructures. This approach involves collecting in-plane SEM images and using FIB to remove material layers for imaging subsequent planes, thereby producing image stacks. However, these image stacks in FIB-SEM tomography are subject to the shine-through effect, which makes structures visible from the posterior regions of the current plane. This artifact introduces an ambiguity between image intensity and structures in the current plane, making conventional segmentation methods such as thresholding or the k-means algorithm insufficient. In this study, we propose a multimodal machine learning approach that combines intensity information obtained at different electron beam accelerating voltages to improve the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of nanostructures. By treating the increased shine-through effect at higher accelerating voltages as a form of additional information, the proposed method significantly improves segmentation accuracy and leads to more precise 3D reconstructions for real FIB tomography data.
