In focused ion beam (FIB) tomography, a combination of FIB with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used for collecting a series of planar images of the microstructure of nanoporous materials. These planar images serve as the basis for reconstructing the three-dimensional microstructure through segmentation algorithms. However, the assumption of a constant distance between consecutively imaged sections is generally invalid due to random variations in the FIB milling process. This variation complicates the accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional microstructure. Using synthetic FIB tomography data, we present an algorithm that repositions slices according to their actual thickness and interpolates the results using machine learning-based methods. We applied our algorithm to real datasets, comparing two standard approaches of microstructure reconstruction: on-the-fly via image processing and ruler-based via sample structuring. Our findings indicate that the ruler-based method, combined with our novel slice repositioning and interpolation algorithm, exhibits superior performance in reconstructing the microstructure.
